## ✅ What is JIRA?
- A project management tool by Atlassian.
- Used to **track issues**, **plan sprints**, and **monitor progress**.
- Commonly used in **Agile/Scrum environments**.

## 🧩 JIRA in DevOps Workflow
- **User Stories / Tasks** created for each DevOps activity (e.g., CI/CD setup).
- **Backlogs** managed and prioritized via Product Owner.
- **Sprints** track 1–2 week goals (e.g., “Set up Jenkins pipeline”).
- **Boards (Kanban/Scrum)** help visualize workflow.

## 🔄 Typical DevOps Tickets in JIRA
| Ticket Type | Example Task                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Story       | Create Dockerfile for microservice  |
| Task        | Set up monitoring with Prometheus   |
| Bug         | Fix Jenkins pipeline failure        |
| Epic        | CI/CD pipeline implementation       |

## 🧠 From a Learner’s POV:
- Think of JIRA as your **DevOps to-do app**.
- Break down complex setups (like CI/CD) into **manageable stories**.
- Use JIRA to **track your own learning tasks**, just like real-world teams.
- Helps build a **project mindset**, not just tool knowledge.
